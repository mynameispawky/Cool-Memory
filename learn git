I'm watching Daniel Shiffman's github tutorial video.
Ooops.here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY
I read many blogs and books of other guys explanning the fancy command line or deep theory of git.
But he is the first teacher who told a starter learning github by using the github web app first.
Understand Master and branch by the tree metaphor.
