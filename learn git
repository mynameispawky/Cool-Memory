I'm watching Daniel Shiffman's github tutorial video.
Ooops.here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY
I read many blogs and books of other guys.
But he is the only one who teachs a green hand to start learning github from using the web app itself.
Understand Master and branch by the tree metaphor.
